<h2>
    Overview of Bass Fishing in Southern Oregon
</h2>
<p>
    Southern Oregon has long been known for its steelhead and salmon fisheries, but a rising number of anglers are discovering the incredible <strong>bass fishing near Medford</strong>. Whether you’re chasing feisty smallmouths or battling trophy largemouths, the lakes and rivers in this region offer year-round action and scenic beauty.
</p>
<h3>
    Why Medford is a Hotspot
</h3>
<p>
    Medford’s location in the Rogue Valley gives anglers access to a wide variety of warmwater lakes and slow-moving rivers—all within a short drive. Several lakes are regularly stocked with bass or support self-sustaining populations, while local tournaments keep the sport competitive and thriving.
</p>
<h3>
    The Growth of Warmwater Fisheries
</h3>
<p>
    With climate shifts and reservoir development, bass have flourished in many Southern Oregon waters. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has also embraced the importance of warmwater fisheries, stocking and maintaining several productive lakes.
</p>
<h2>
    Types of Bass Found Near Medford
</h2>
<h3>
    Largemouth Bass
</h3>
<p>
    Largemouths thrive in weedy, warm, and shallow water. They're the most commonly targeted species in local lakes like Agate and Emigrant. Known for their explosive surface strikes and strong fight, they’re a favorite among anglers of all levels.
</p>
<h3>
    Smallmouth Bass
</h3>
<p>
    Found in deeper, rockier water, smallmouth bass inhabit the Rogue River and Applegate Lake. While less abundant than largemouths, they’re prized for their aggressiveness and tenacity.
</p>
<h3>
    Spotted/Hybrid Bass in Select Areas
</h3>
<p>
    Although rare in the Rogue Valley, hybrid species and spotted bass may occasionally show up in southern waters connected to the Sacramento River basin. Identification and retention rules apply—check ODFW guidelines.
