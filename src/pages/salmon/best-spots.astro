<h2>
    Top Access Points Worth Visiting
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Cole Rivers Hatchery / McGregor Park / Casey SRS</strong> — great bank fishing and proximity to quality runs
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Valley of the Rogue State Park</strong> — dip-in/float start point near Grants Pass for Middle Rogue drift fishing 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Robertson Bridge Boat Ramp</strong> (Merlin)—lake elevation bank &amp; boat ramp access for salmon, steelhead, and trout
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Agness area and Rogue Bay</strong> — more remote, holds large aggregations of fish in fall 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>TouVelle Park &amp; Sewer Hole</strong> — easy wade access and marked hatchery fish opportunities using fly or spin gear
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Angling Tips to Keep in Mind
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Spring Chinook</strong> respond well to bait rigs using pink/roe under a float or bottomed with light weight; back‑bounce baits from boats are effective 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fall fishing</strong> often relies on drift rigs near submerged structure and tailouts. Float-spinning with spinners or light plugs can also be effective .
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Coho</strong> are best targeted with smaller bright spinners (e.g. blue fox) or flasher-roe combinations in September–October 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Steelhead overlap runs</strong> especially in Applegate tributaries and lower Rogue; note retention is limited to <strong>hatchery‑marked</strong> fish only .
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Community &amp; Conservation
</h2>
<p>
    During fall runs, salmon viewing hikes are popular at McGregor Park and along the Applegate River. These are great for families and offer a first-hand glimpse of salmon behavior prior to spawning. Consider supporting groups like Rogue Riverkeeper or KS Wild to help preserve spawning habitat and clean river access
</p>
<h2>
    In Summary
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Best spot for Spring Chinook:</strong> Upper Rogue near Shady Cove &amp; Lost Creek Dam
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prime Fall Salmon &amp; Coho:</strong> Middle to Lower Rogue (Gold Hill → Agness)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Easy local access for wading/family trips:</strong> TouVelle, Casey, Hatchery Hole
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Remote but scenic option:</strong> Lower Rogue around Agness and Rogue Bay
    </li>
    <li>
        Use <strong>drift/float rigs with roe or plugs</strong>, match colors to clarity, and check regulations for retention limits on hatchery vs wild fish
    </li>
</ul>
