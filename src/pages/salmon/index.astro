<h2>
    Why Medford is a Hidden Gem for Salmon Anglers
</h2>
<p>
    Tucked in the heart of the Rogue Valley, <strong>Medford, Oregon</strong> sits in prime proximity to some of the best salmon fishing rivers in the Pacific Northwest. While Portland and the Columbia often take center stage, Medford offers a quieter, more accessible salmon experience that’s just as rewarding—without the crowds.
</p>
<h3>
    Geographical Advantage
</h3>
<p>
    Medford lies near several productive rivers including the Rogue, Applegate, and Illinois. These waters are known for healthy salmon populations, scenic landscapes, and a variety of fishing options suitable for all skill levels.
</p>
<h3>
    Access to Famous Southern Oregon Rivers
</h3>
<p>
    Anglers based in Medford can reach top-tier salmon spots in under an hour. Whether you’re casting from the bank or drifting downriver, you’ll find numerous public access points and boat ramps within easy driving distance.
</p>
<h2>
   Types of Salmon Found Near Medford
</h2>
<h3>
   Chinook (King) Salmon
</h3>
<p>
    The Rogue River is world-renowned for its Chinook runs. Both spring and fall Chinook can be found in these waters, with fall runs often being the most productive for sport fishing.
</p>
<h3>
    Coho (Silver) Salmon
</h3>
<p>
    Though less abundant than Chinook, Coho salmon are still available in select tributaries and estuary areas. They're known for their acrobatics and willingness to hit flashy lures.
</p>
<h3>
    Occasional Sockeye and Steelhead Mixes
</h3>
<p>
    While Sockeye are rare this far south, the Rogue often sees a healthy influx of steelhead, which provide bonus action and are often mistaken for smaller salmon when hooked.

    How Weather and Water Levels Affect Salmon

</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        First heavy rain of the fall often sparks upstream migration
    </li>
    <li>
        Rising rivers = fresh fish moving upstream
    </li>
    <li>
        Too much flow = muddy water, harder fishing
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Best Times of Day to Fish
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Early morning (sunrise–10 AM)</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
