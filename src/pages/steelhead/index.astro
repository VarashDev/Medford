<h2>
    Introduction to Steelhead Fishing in Southern Oregon
</h2>
<p>
    Steelhead are the elusive prize of the Pacific Northwest—strong, beautiful, and unpredictable. For anglers near <strong>Medford, Oregon</strong>, the nearby rivers provide an ideal playground for pursuing these sea-run rainbow trout. With consistent runs, public access, and breathtaking landscapes, Southern Oregon is a top destination for steelhead fishing.
</p>
<h3>
    What Makes Steelhead Unique
</h3>
<p>
    Unlike salmon, steelhead can spawn multiple times in their lives and often return to the ocean afterward. This means they're not only more resilient but also offer year-round fishing potential in many areas. Their reputation as strong fighters makes them a favorite among both fly and spin anglers.
</p>
<h3>
    Why Medford is an Ideal Launch Point
</h3>
<p>
    Medford is centrally located within an hour of several key steelhead rivers, including the Rogue, Applegate, and Illinois. Whether you prefer fly fishing from the bank or drifting in a jet boat, Medford provides quick and convenient access to excellent water.

<h2>
    Steelhead Migration and Run Patterns
</h2>
<h3>
    Summer Steelhead vs. Winter Steelhead
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Summer Steelhead</strong>: Enter rivers as early as May and remain in freshwater until they spawn in winter. Often more active and aggressive in clear water.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Winter Steelhead</strong>: Begin entering rivers from November through March. These fish are typically larger and move in higher flows.
    </li>
</ul>
